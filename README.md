# Delta
A greenhouse that detects moisture and you can manually activate water pumps to water your plants. This project also can have you tell time and when you last watered it. This project can be used without being hooked up with HDMI as you can see soil moisture if the piece has a green light on or not. The code is fairly simple but has a chance to crash Thonny or maybe your Raspberry Pi. Our group is Kaleb Grosstick, Aaron Fehland, Jacob Crocker, and Colin French and we are from Lexington High School, our project was a simple design that is cost efficient and works as you need it to. Everything about this is simple and could be made by normal people and maybe even kids obviously with supervision. We had some 3d printed parts which held our pumps so they didnt pinch on the board.
